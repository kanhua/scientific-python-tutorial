[Showcases](https://www.python.org/about/success/#scientific) shows what you can do with python in scientific research.


### Where can I download?

Although you can download the python language itself and the packages one by one from each website, but it's a very lengthy and tiresome work for beginners. 

Fortunately, the company [continuum](http://continuum.io) does this job for you. They collect the most popular python packages along with the python core languages into one package, so you can just download it and go! What's the most important is IT'S FREE!
