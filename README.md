# Tutorial for scientific python

Python is an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use programming languages. The simplicity and extensibiliy of python makes it a good choice for many purposes, including scientific computing.

This tutorial is designed for researchers and students in semiconductor physics with no programming background. Since there are huge amounts of high quality introductory python courses around, this project does not intend to reinvent those wheels. Instead, we focus on how to apply this tool to their day-to-day jobs.

We suggest the beginner to download the entire scientific python distribution from Anaconda. The instructions can be found [here](quickstart.md).
